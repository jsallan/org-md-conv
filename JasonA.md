		- *Edison*
it helps you get to level 6 sooner
opens doors for travel and exposure
		- *Confidence*
If I ratched up the arrogance a bit.
If Shirley is picking the next dept lead, Tom wants her to pick me.
Try it more situationally depending on who I'm talking to, outside the group I talk to everyday.

*Srinidhi example:*
default response is collaborative
instead, try: *I think we should do this, but we can chat about the details.*

		- AMP-X
What cool vision statements could we drum up? unit tests, what's the HW strategy to support AMP-X?
	- Innovation
One voice survey still called out this as an area that needs improvement.

Bring more customer voice to our user stories. What brings pain relief to the customer pain points. Move beyond Marketing telling us that we need feature X.

Doesn't need to be this big new feature. Can solve a small customer pain point.

Could this be a Hygiene type of performance objective? i.e. if nothing was done, it doesn't detract from your overall, but if you did something, bonus.

State it as an ambition.
	- People, build the best team
Appreciated my energy towards this topic.

Edison will be a KPI in 2022
	- Opportunities
Too many meetings.

Who is the next JA? Need delegation, think succession. What else can I unload?

Trying too hard to achieve consensus.

Say no to a topic.

PO next-step: template a HH story, move to a delete scope instead of add.

Strength finder 2.0

How can I have the same confidence as TPO and FM that I do with part shortage? What would it look like if I was a bit more cocky or arrogant?
		- Personal Reflection
I feel very confident on the part shortable topic.
